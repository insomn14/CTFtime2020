Another day, another CTF challenge.

Ok, did you read that article? Good. So your challenge is to crack a password. Just like Ken Thompson, our password will be in a 'known format'.
The format we'll use is: color-random_year-neverlan_team_member's_name. (all lowercase)

A sample password could be: red-1991-s7a73farm

Here's your hash: 267530778aa6585019c98985eeda255f. The hashformat is md5.
