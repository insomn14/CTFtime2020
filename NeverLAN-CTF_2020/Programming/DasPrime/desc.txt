My assignments due and I still don't have the answer! Can you help me fix my Python script... and also give me the answer? I need to make a prime number generator and find the 10,497th prime number. I've already written a python script that kinda works... can you either fix it or write your own and tell me the prime number?

import math
def main():
    primes = []
    count = 2
    index = 0
    while True:
        isprime = False
        for x in range(2, int(math.sqrt(count) + 1)):
            if count % x == 0: 
                isprime = True
                continue
        if isprime:
            primes.append(count)
            print(index, primes[index])
            index += 1
        count += 1
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

*Your flag won't be in the normal flag{flagGoesHere} syntax. Instead you're looking for a prime number.
