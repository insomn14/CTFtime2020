Laser 1 - Factoring 480 Points
https://github.com/Quintec/LaserLang

Do you like lasers? I like lasers! Here's a warmup: create a program that factors the one number given as input. Output factors on one line in ascending order (or just leave them on the stack, as Laser has implicit output)

Example
Input: 42
Output: 1 2 3 6 7 14 21 42
