Picking Up The Pieces 403 Points
Can you help me? I had a flag that I bought at the store, but on the way home, I dropped parts of it on some roads! Now some roads have strings of text, and I can't tell which are part of my flag. I'm very smart and efficient (but somehow not smart or efficient enough to keep my flag), so I know that I took the fastest way from the store back to my house.

I have a map with a list of all 200000 roads between intersections, and what strings are on them. The format of the map is <intersection 1> <intersection 2> <distance> <string on the road>. My house is at intersection 1 and the store is at intersection 200000.
